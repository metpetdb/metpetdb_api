<p id ="first_para">MetPetDB is a database for metamorphic petrology that is being designed and built by a global community of metamorphic petrologists in collaboration with computer scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as part of the National Cyberinfrastructure Initiative and supported by the National Science Foundation.</p>
<br>
<p>This project will support the development, implementation and population of MetPetDB with the purpose of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>archiving published data</li>
	<br>
    <li>storing new data for ready access to researchers and students</li>
    <br>
    <li>facilitating the gathering of information for researchers beginning new projects</li>
    <br>
    <li>providing a search mechanism for data relating to anywhere on the globe</li>
    <br>
    <li>providing a platform for collaborative studies among researchers</li>
    <br>
    <li>serving as a portal for students beginning their studies of metamorphic geology</li>
